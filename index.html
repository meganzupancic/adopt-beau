    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi! I’m <strong>Beau</strong> (my full name is "Beaumont", but I respond to Beau), a <strong>3-year-old neutered male dog</strong> who’s full of energy and love. I enjoy <strong>car rides</strong>, going for <strong>walks</strong>, and getting my exercise in by being a <strong>great runner and walker</strong>. I’m <strong>leash trained</strong> and love <strong>playing games</strong> like tug-of-war with my <strong>toys</strong>! I'm a <strong>friendly</strong> guy who will say <strong>hello to anyone</strong> who looks at me!</p>

    <p>Although I can get excited at first, I <strong>calm down very quickly</strong> and settle into a <strong>relaxed</strong>, <strong>affectionate</strong> mood. I’m like a <strong>puppy at heart</strong>, but I know how to be a <strong>sweet</strong>, <strong>chill companion</strong> when I need to be. I’m also a <strong>huge snuggler</strong> — if you’re sitting down, you’ll find me right next to you, resting my head on your lap!</p>
    
    <p>I’m <strong>house-trained</strong>, <strong>house-broken</strong>, and <strong>non-destructive</strong>. I can be <strong>left alone</strong> in a room and will sleep peacefully while you’re gone. I’ve been <strong>working on crate training</strong>, and I’m making progress, though I’m not fully trained yet. I love to <strong>sunbathe</strong> in warm spots and <strong>enjoy treats</strong> (they’re my favorite!).</p>
    
    <p>Although I’m still learning, I’m a <strong>loyal</strong> and <strong>loving companion</strong> who just wants to be close to you. I may be <strong>young at heart</strong>, but I promise, I’m the <strong>perfect mix of playful and relaxed</strong>! I also have <strong>no current health conditions</strong> — I’m just looking for someone to love me as much as I’ll love them.</p>
